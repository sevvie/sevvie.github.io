================

A lot of change is planned for 2015. It's going to take discipline, but amongst those
is committing or contributing on github, at least once a day, for the entire year 2015. 
Luckily, this new blog I'm setting up will be helpful in that endeavour -- I'm also 
going to publish some of my (edited) writing, at least thrice a week, for the entire year
as well.

Here's the bad news: if you're seeing this, you're gonna witness another terrifying lame
reboot of what I do every year, if not twice a year; trashing the whole site and starting
over. I have a secret weapon -- one that should encourage creating and committing to these
habits. Before the inevitable `push -f` comes, though; know that one thing I'm committed to
is recovering old blog posts from anywhere and everywhere (hello, Wayback Machine). But
first, I gotta get the blog show-worthy and compiling right.
