Okay, I'm done making little changes, and more little changes, and more little changes... for today. I will
accept that I now have a blog, since it can be entirely under my control with a little effort and finaggling;
thankfully, I've put in that effort now (and it was as little effort as I could muster, really) and have
a site that won't vanish in a couple weeks along with the transcripts from my videos.

Speaking of which, videos: I'm going to be putting in the effort to embed them where the big Nazi Girl image
shows up on the index page, but that isn't the case just yet. I can embed them without worry, just... not
in that spot just yet.

It's rather late, now; I need to relax and enjoy myself. On the docket: SMITE in Wine.
