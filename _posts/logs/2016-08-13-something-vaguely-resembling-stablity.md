exerpt: "Sure, ask me for chaos and I'll break the legs on all the fainting-couches
in the country, by shouting 'cunt' in Millenial's faces. Regular stability, though..."

With regards to chaos, unpredictability and unique angles of perspective, most
would agree I have quite the practiced skill; however, it's safe to say that
all those normal things that humans do, like scheduled habits and not yelling
'cunt' at unsuspecting Americans without a nearby fainting-couch. I've not had
a regular career in over a decade; rather, it was contracts and independently-
contracted employees that allowed me my wild, high-functioning drug-haze-fueled
programming and leadership. These days, though, I'm finding it much harder to
rely on pure whathefuckopathic madness to maintain stability and security in
my life.

But enough of you successful, attractive motherfuckers out there have expressed
concern for my quality of life and stability of food and security that I can't
idly ignore it much longer. A regular job is, statistically speaking, at least
two months away, though; getting to producing two regular videos a week, building
up endurance and will through never missing a deadline. That said, I'm not going
to make my previous mistakes; I'm going to be giving myself a small selection of
shows that might be posted for each deadline, to allow for a change of pace while
still keeping up with the practiced habit.
